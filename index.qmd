# What is Causal Inference? {data-background-color="#425563" data-verticator="#E8EDEE"}

A Fancy Name for an Old Way of Thinking

## The Study of Cause & Effect {.center}

- Causal inference is the process of estimating the mechanisms by which changes in variables (causes) lead to changes in an outcome (the effect).
- It seeks to establish a cause-and-effect that is generalisable and substantively meaningful in the real world. 
- It's more than just Randomised Controlled Trials!

## Correlation != Causation {.center .smaller}

</br></br>

$$E[Y|T=1] - E[Y|T=0] = \underbrace{E[Y_1 - Y_0|T=1]}_{ATT} + \underbrace{\{ E[Y_0|T=1] - E[Y_0|T=0] \}}_{BIAS}$$

## Moving Beyond "Associations" {.center}

- We are often interested in questions of "cause", but we use methods (and language) more fit for description.
- It is very common to see the term "association" used, to avoid claiming the outcome has been "caused" by our predictors (I am guilty of this).
  - But association still implies some causal effect [@haber2022].
  - And the recommendations and implications of the research clearly indicate a belief that the findings are causal!
  
## Schrödinger’s Causal Inference {.center}

> Our results suggest that “Schrödinger’s causal inference,” — where studies avoid stating (or even explicitly deny) an interest in estimating causal effects yet are otherwise embedded with causal intent, inference, implications, and recommendations — is common.

## More Than a Name {.center}

- While "causal inference" has become the popular terminology, these ideas are not entirely new.
- However, the approach (DAGs, explicit processes for drawing causal conclusions) has made the old methods more precise.
- Much of causal inference focuses on methods for making causal claims possible when dealing with observational data.

Understanding the Type of Questions We're Asking & the Different Methods for Answering Them

## The Challenge {.center}

- It is sometimes difficult to tell whether you are dealing with description, prediction, or explanation.
- This is because methods like regression are appropriate for all three and the way we talk about each often blurs the lines [@barrett2024].

## Description - What Happened? {.center}

- "Description is using data to provide a quantitative summary of certain features of the world." [@hernan2019]
- Description is concerned with understanding **what** happened.
- Counting events, estimating central tendencies (mean, median, mode) and variance, and visualising distributions.
- Often used in combination with prediction and causal inference.

## Counting Things is Good, Actually {.center}

- Description is frequently treated as a lesser task, but I think this is fundamentally wrong.
- Counting is one of the best things we can do with data [@barrett2024]!
- It can be very valuable when the [quantity](https://www.ft.com/content/a2901ce8-5eb7-4633-b89c-cbdf5b386938) is extremely important.
- It can also be sufficient if we already know a lot about it from previous causal work.

## Don't Mistake Description for Explanation! {.center}

- It is very easy to fall into the trap of treating description as causal, or using causal terms when discussing descriptive findings.

## Prediction - What Will Happen? {.center}

- "Prediction is using data to map some features of the world (the inputs) to other features of the world (the outputs)." [@hernan2019]
- Prediction focuses on identifying what will happen in the future.
  - How many A&E attendances will occur in the next hour, day, week, or month? 
  - What is the probability of an individual suffering a health episode?
- Machine learning is very good at answering these kinds of questions.
  
## Causal Inference - What Was the Cause? {.center}

- Causal inference tries to identify and quantify cause and effect.
  - What are the primary causal factors that define how long someone will wait in A&E?
  - What are the environmental factors that lead to someone developing cancer?
  - Do virtual wards reduce the quantity of hospital attendances an individual experiences?

## The Differences Between Predictive & Causal Models {.center}

- Causal models are interested in unbiased estimates, prediction focuses on reducing error.
- Predictive models can (and should) include plenty of correlations
- With causal models, fewer variables and focus should be on causal mechanism
- A causal model can identify a small but meaningful effect that would not predict the outcome on its own and this would still be useful!

## Conclusion {.center}

- Understanding the type of question you're asking will define the methods you will use to find the answer.
- No approach is inherently more valuable, but they serve specific purposes!
- Treating description as demonstrating causality is problematic.
- Treating prediction and explanation as equivalent will lead to building models that are not fit for the task.
